# Friday Night Funkin' - Lemoniado Mod
This mod started in [Kade Mod Tool](https://github.com/NeeEoo/Kade-Mod-Tool), months later, it was ported to Psych Engine 0.4.2's mods folder. 2 versions later, it started being a Source Code Mod. After that, the mod launched oficially, and now, there are a 1.1 that might be cancelled, because i don't open the folder since 2/4/23 (So much time). Probably a Cancelled build will be launched (And probably a reboot!!)

This mod are original FNF songs, but with a shitty story in spanish.
